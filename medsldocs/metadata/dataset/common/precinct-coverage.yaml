        Party-line voting appears in the data as `office` values of `Straight
        Party` and `candidate` values of, for example, `Alabama Republican Party`.
        To calculate vote totals, sum the votes candidates' received on their
        own lines and from party-line voting.

  Alaska:
    included: true
    date_added: 2018-03-11

        Because EAVS data are unavailable for Alaska, the `county_` identifiers
        for county-equivalents are missing.

        Returns from some counties do not yet give `district` values when office
        is `State House` or `State Senate`.

        In the raw data, it seems that votes for unopposed candidates sometimes
        appear twice: once under a candidate's name and again in totals for all
        unopposed candidates. But these totals are slightly lower than the sum
        of votes for all unopposed candidates. We've dropped them.

        Chicago, Danville, East St. Louis, Galesburg, and Rockford. We joined their returns with `county_` identifiers
