      Massachusetts and New York returns often contains entries for "blank," "other/blank," "scattering/blank," and the
      like. For analyses that depend on an accurate count of votes cast for candidates (rather than turnout, including
      blank ballots), consult state returns. Future versions of this dataset will distinguish blank ballots from votes
      cast for scattering candidates.
